# This manifest is not enabled or used by default, but here for disaster recovery situations, to know the spec
# needed to get a snapshot from AWS and generate the Kubernetes VolumeSnapshotContent at change.
# Pay special attention to the 'snapshotHandle' parameter, because it is there to match the cloud resource
